This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project built with Supabase for a backend service and database and Tailwind CSS for styling.

This is a ticket app where you can create new tickets and delete them once they're done.
To get into the system you need to create an account or log in using an authentication system.

To log in without creating a new account and test the app functionality, use the following credentials:
```
email: sytnikov.alexey@gmail.com
password: 123456
```

There's a ticket protection system implemented, so you can delete only those tickets that were created under your email.
